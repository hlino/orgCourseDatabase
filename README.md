This project is a website which allows students in organizations to create a profile and record courses in which they have taken. Students can also search for courses in which their peers have taken in order to easily figure out who to contact if they have a question about a particular course, whether that be before or while they are taking it. This webiste uses the umd.io api in order to populate professor and course information. The website was built using jquery, handlebars, and node.js.
